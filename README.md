# NumericIntegrationOptimization

This was done as voluntary Uni-coursework.
The challenge was to optimize a numerical integration algorithm.

**Constraints:**

- Pure Python 3, only built-in modules (no numpy etc.)
- Numerical integration; no function-specific analytical expressions
- No parallelisation 
- No compilers / JIT compilation (Cython, Numba, PyPy, etc.)
- Result matches the SciPy result within the given tolerance
